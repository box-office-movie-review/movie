<p><strong>Village Movie Theater Austin</strong>. The staff was great with ordering food/drinks, the emcee was awesome as she got us all into the start of the movie, and the movie house was clean, comfortable, and enjoyable as we watched one of my favorite holida. they had specialized appetizers named for the new jurassic movie (triceratots) and drinks (drankosaurus) which made it all the more fun and they were all delicious. From downtown austin, head west on sixth street and merge onto highway 1 (mopac) north. Exit on anderson lane and turn right (east) onto anderson lane. Nestled into the community first!</p>
