<p>You’ll be presented with a virtual movie theater for your viewing enjoyment. Oculus, steam, vive, gear vr, and daydream how you can watch movies: Pigasus has an awesome cinematic feel to it, and while not quite at the level of some of our other virtual reality cinema apps today, is a fairly decent choice for those of you who want to replicate the feel of a night out that includes a quick trip to the cinema. It provided some great immersive feeling for a very large movie theatre. Bigscreen tv watch movies, news, twitch, sports, and dozens of free live tv channels with friends in vr. Vr videos are meant for the platform, 360, and 3d panoramic videos really have no other way to be maximized, and even a standard movie played back in an oculus headset can be a fantastic experience.</p>
