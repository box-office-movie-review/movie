<p>The ht3550 is on the cheaper end of 4k home theater projectors, which can be up to four times as expensive, but still manages to produce sharp and dynamic images.

Building your own screen for a home theater protector can give you an excellent picture and still save you dollars you can put towards the projector or your sound system.
