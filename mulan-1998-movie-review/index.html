Mulan (1998 film) review the 1998 movie mulan came out when i was just ten years old and i don�t know why i never saw it. Undiscriminating young children, teenagers with short attention spans, and adults with somewhat more refined standards. Parents need to know that although mulan is a decidedly disneyfied take on a chinese fairy tale, elements of chinese culture and history ring true.</p>

<p>Online reviewers have written 787 reviews, giving mulan (1998) an average rating of 79%. Like fox�s anastasia,�� this is a film that adults can enjoy on their own, without feeling an obligation to take along kids as a cover. The 2020 remake has a few key differences from the 1998 original, but the main storyline stays the same. Movies, tv, celebs, and more. We saw glimpses of what a strong female lead would look like with belle in beauty and the beast (1991), jasmine in aladdin (1992), and pocahontas (1995). Mhm�s film reviews are now exclusively on youtube.</p>
