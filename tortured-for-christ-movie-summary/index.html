<p>Filmed entirely in romania, including in the very prison where pastor wurmbrand endured. Pastor richard wurmbrand suffered 14 years of imprisonment and brutal torture, while his wife, sabina, was treated as a slave in a labor camp their only “crimes” were their faith and witness for jesus christ. In tortured for christ, richard wurmbrand wrote, “the tortures and brutality continued without interruption. The main character is a woman, but she is not sabina, his wife. Even today, believers are suffering and dying for christ, yet their faith will not falter under the most unthinkable persecutions. In the ensuing years, in several different prisons, they broke four vertebrae in my back, and many other bones.</p>
