<p>Over its many years, the one piece franchise has spawned fourteen movies of varying quality. People love this movie the best out of one piece movies, yet while i love it too, movie 6 is still my favorite, but that�s just my taste. The series is close to reaching 1000 chapters and 100 published volumes, which tell the adventures of the straw hat pirates over 9 sagas and more than 30 arcs.one piece has already been adapted to an animated series, several movies, special episodes, ovas. One piece chronological watching order (with movies &amp; ovas) misc okay so before i even start i know a bunch of people are gonna say something about how the movies aren�t canon and yes, obviously they aren�t but the point of this post is to help people who want to know where to watch them in a timeline order regardless. Definitely watch this one though. One piece is a manga written and illustrated by eiichiro oda and published in weekly shōnen jump magazine since 1997.</p>
