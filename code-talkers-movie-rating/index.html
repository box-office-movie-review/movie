Marines in world war ii are assigned to protect navajo marines, who use their native language as an unbreakable radio cypher.

Their code was unbreakable, and because of their role, the navajo established mandatory navajo language and culture education alongside the english language. Windtalkers, however, sinks under too many clichés and only superficially touches upon the story of the code talkers. Erickson was the executive producer.</p>
