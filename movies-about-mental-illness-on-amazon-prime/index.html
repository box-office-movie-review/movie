<p><strong>Movies About Mental Illness On Amazon Prime</strong>. My descriptions will indicate which mental illness or neurological condition is exhibited by which character (if known). There are hundreds of extremely worthy films that have been made over the years that deal with the issue of mental illness, but these ones are fantastic and (in most cases) very educational. The 2011 science fiction psychological drama film melancholia is not the only film that lars von trier directed which features themes of mental illness. All will contain some sort of mental or neurological disorder that should be one of the main themes of the film.</p>
