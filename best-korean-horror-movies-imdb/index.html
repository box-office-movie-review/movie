<p>10 best korean horror movies. The 10 best south korean films (according to imdb) imdb has its own list of korean films. It won for best foreign language film at the 1961 academy awards, and was also the basis for the 1972 exploitation horror film the last house on the left. With summer fast approaching, one of the primary ways in south korea to stay cool during hot days is to stay in and watch chillingly scary horror movies. The film contains a number of themes that question morals, justice, and religious beliefs, and was considered controversial when first released due to its infamous rape scene. A tale of two sisters is not only one of the best horror movies ever made, but also one of the best movies of all time, in my opinion.</p>
