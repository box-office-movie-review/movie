<p><strong>The Hatred Movie Review</strong>. The hatred (movie review) september 25, 2017. The downside is that the straightforward speed races right past every opportunity for originality that might add an energetic edge. It commits all the sins of the genre, hiring terrible actors to work off a barely coherent script, all while somehow managing to be boring and not at all frightening. It�s a horror, but here you are the villain.</p>

<p>The hatred feels like a movie that has been based upon the first draft of a script. The review (spoiler free) the hatred is a haunted house/paranormal horror film with interesting premise. We quickly learned that he is member of nazi and he is working directly with hitler. However, the movie itself is just drawn out and unappealing. Not sure why they included the grandmom at all. One of the newest releases in the anchor bay family, the hatred made its way to dvd, digital hd, and on demand on september 12th via lionsgate.</p>

<p>With michalina labacz, arkadiusz jakubik, wasyl wasylik, adrian zaremba. A decent first draft at that, but still, there are so many plot holes, the movie begins to resemble an empty graveyard. I would love to say that i enjoyed this movie but there was a fair bit that let it down. Don�t hate the player, hate the game. Overall, the hatred is visually appealing but those looking for more than just visuals will be very disappointed. Critic reviews for the hatred.</p>
