<p>How romantic it is to… Is this a place or activity you would suggest for Quirky, friendly, polite, and helpful. However, as other theaters begin to change with the times, i can�t help but feel that bellingham is due for an upgrade. Regal theater ticket prices, you may have noticed, are a little above the average ticket price offered by other theater chains. I went last week for the first time in years and the seats were ripped and loose.</p>

<p>Find the movies showing at theaters near you and buy movie tickets at fandango. Mobile, print, kiosk see details. So all the seats are good. I used to come to this theater all the time growing up in milford. Super cute theater because it is so small and kinda feels like a private theater.
