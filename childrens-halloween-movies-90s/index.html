<p><strong>Childrens Halloween Movies 90s</strong>. When it comes to television, halloween isn’t quite what it used to be, especially from the late ‘70s to the early ‘90s. When we set out to list the greatest halloween movies and tv specials us ’90s kids can watch with our kids, it got us thinking about the many joys of being a parent. (the dark crystal, return to oz, the monster squad), and ’90s classics present and accounted for (the witches, hocus pocus, casper). Although television still continues the trend of special halloween episodes (originally started by roseanne), there are more than a few iconic halloween specials which have fallen to the wayside.</p>
