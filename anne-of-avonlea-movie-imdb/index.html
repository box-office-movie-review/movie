<p><strong>Anne Of Avonlea Movie Imdb</strong>. A young rich girl is sent to live with relatives on prince edward island in the early 1900s. I really enjoyed this miniseries, despite the low production values and that the details seem a bit squished at certain times (perhaps because they tried to squeeze almost five years of anne�s life in four episodes). She makes the acquaintance of a handsome, rich, bachelor, chases a cow, and wins (to her chagrin) a baking soda company�s writing contest. Anne of avonlea continues the story of anne shirley (kim braden) the heroine of anne of green gables as she begins her job as a schoolteacher and faces a whole new set of challenges.</p>
