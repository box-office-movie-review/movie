<p>Many people mistakenly think movie posters are numbered/limited editions. Jaws was directed by steven spielberg and starred roy scheider, robert shaw and richard dreyfuss. It wasn’t trying to explain the whole movie or even multiple scenes. What effect do these techniques have on the viewer? For example, the empire strikes back “gone with the wind” poster (below right) was printed with five printing plates. The rear window poster was not the 54th out of 337 printed!</p>
