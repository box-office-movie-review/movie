<p>The schedule kicks off on memorial day weekend and runs through labor day. Settle back and enjoy an outdoor flick!. To find out what movies will be shown, check these facebook events periodically. The weekend movie series is free to attend, but parking is limited. Now, there are at least five of them, either up and running or in the works. For an extra dose of nostalgia, cartoon advertisements created decades ago are still shown before the movie (yes, their concession stand still sells pic!).</p>
