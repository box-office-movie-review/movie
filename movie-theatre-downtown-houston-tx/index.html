<p>Movie times, buy movie tickets online, watch trailers and get directions to amc houston 8, formerly sundance houston 8 in houston, tx. The district began its revitalization efforts in 1995 with five key goals in mind: The downtown district has been a major player in most of the public/private projects that have transformed downtown over the last decade. Accelerate the renewal of the city�s urban core, with quality of life as the underlying theme: Downtown’s premier theater venues, alley theatre, jones hall and wortham theater center, all sit within a block from one another with the hobby center for the performing arts located just a hop, skip and a jump away. My husband and i were celebrating our 9 year anniversary and after seeing they were playing a good movie i knew my husband liked, i booked us 2 tickets.</p>
