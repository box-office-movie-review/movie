<p>Second chances, based upon true events, is a clean, family friendly movie that will have boys and girls, moms and dads, and yes, even tweens and teens, cheering for sunny matthews as she rides her horse, ginger (a crippled horse, at the beginning of the film and a champion race horse at its conclusion).</p>
