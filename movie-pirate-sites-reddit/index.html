<p>I got a lot of reddit hate for requesting this ama. But nothing has stopped the site to come back again. Focusing exclusively on movies, yts.mx is the unofficial successor of the defunct yts group, which released several thousands of movies before it was shut down in 2015. Whenever i want to watch an old tv show or play a game from my childhood, i first visit amazon video, netflix, stream, and so, but i usually end up on the pirate bay because that’s the only place where a lot of old and obscure content is available. I mean, you see a future with no longer more pirate sites and all this content provided by sites like youtube and spotify (in a legal way). Around 44% of all the content on the pirate bay is tv and movies.</p>
