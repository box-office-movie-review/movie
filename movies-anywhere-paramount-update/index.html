<p>No matter where you purchase your favorite movies*, movies anywhere lets you bring them together in one app. Disney movies anywhere long competed with ultraviolet, another digital locker service backed by sony, paramount and lionsgate. And hell, that might be reason enough to make this new system worthwhile on its own. It enables supported digital films to be synced up to several online storefronts when they are purchased. The company has managed to rally support from a number of major hollywood film studios â€” paramount and lionsgate are the major holdouts â€” and the end result is movies anywhere, a new service. Do you use the movies anywhere service, or have interest in how it works.</p>
