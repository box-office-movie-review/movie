<p>Behr sparkling apple paint is the top choice of diy fans, and the others are solid options if you don’t have a lowes store nearby. Screen paint is now specifically formulated to help increase contrast, adds depth to images, liquefies blacks, and eliminates hot spots. Red and yellow color saturation is the most muted, and white highlights appear as subdued grays. In my opinion, this gives definite. But for the best paints, choose ones with product names such as projection screen paint video screen paint or cinema screen paint found at some of the major home center stores or through online suppliers. Get coordinating colors then preview them in a room image.</p>

<p>What i want to ask you here is if it�s worth it to go to a dark screen with the projector i own, and if yes, what kind of paints should i use and how much of each paint. A lot of people mostly paint walls to watch hd or even 4k videos without spending any extra amount of money. On a lark, i was leafing through the behr swatches at my local home depot, and found the silver screen paint. But a very important part of a screen is a dark border, it makes the image pop, improves apparent contrast, makes it look much more real. Screen paint is now specifically formulated to help increase contrast, adds depth to images, liquefies blacks, and eliminates hot spots. The better definition in colors and blacks makes the painted screen more acceptable over the blackout cloth in almost all instances.</p>
