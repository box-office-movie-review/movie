<h3 id="he-never-speaks-much-in-fear-of-the-other-gang-members-in-his-class">He never speaks much in fear of the other gang members in his class.</h3>
<p>Kids and adults alike believed. He never speaks much in fear of the other gang members in his class. The writer used theory proposed by ninds (national institute of neurological disorder and stroke, 2012) in analyzing dialogues of bradley cohen in the movie script. Tourette syndrome is a nervous system disorder which causes the person to suffer from “tics” which can be described as sudden movements, sounds or twitches that are involuntary and repetitive (cdc, 2015). Cantet�s final tableau shots of the empty classroom, like a deserted battlefield, made the hairs on the back of my neck prickle. The interview scenes with brad were great.</p>
