<p><strong>Working At A Movie Theater Benefits</strong>. My first week working there was during the opening of the new star wars film. When i started working there, each employee got two free movie tickets per day. Working at a movie theater offers perks both during work and after, and here’s why: I�ve worked at a movie theatre for the last five years.</p>

<p>Experiencing a movie in a theater lets you see the film on a huge screen with plenty of detail. Is working at a movie theater a good job? I�m looking for a summer job and the local theater is hiring. As a trainee cinema manager, you’re likely to earn between £15,000 and £21,000 per annum. You also get to see pretty much all the movies for free which is really nice. Is it an overall good job?</p>
<h3 id="working-at-the-movies-can-be-a-fun-first-job-for-a-high-school-student-and-beginning-with-an-entry-level-job-and-sticking-it-out-can-certainly-lead-to-more-responsibilities-and-money-if-a-movie-theater-turns-out-to-be-a-good-fit">Working at the movies can be a fun first job for a high school student, and beginning with an entry level job and sticking it out can certainly lead to more responsibilities (and money) if a movie theater turns out to be a good fit.</h3>
<p>However, as you progress and take on more responsibility, your salary will increase to around £24,000. If you�re into movies its nice because picking up promotional memorabilia is relatively easy. Working as part of a team, a movie theater manager ensures the enjoyment of theater patrons, while. The benefits were mediocre when i worked there as a supervisor and were not available at all to base employees. I do wish management would listen to their staffs ideas and needs but sometimes the hard working staff get pushed to the side. His movie theater pays a little more than most, i think, because it is nicer.</p>
