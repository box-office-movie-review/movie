<p><strong>Reclining Stadium Seating Movie Theatres</strong>. It is just like the chairs in the sports venue, each row of the chairs are higher than that of the front row. Regal theaters with reclining seats kick back and enjoy regal king size recliners at select movie theatre locations. The project also features reserved seating and a cinema cafe offering an assortment of gourmet movie fare. Theaters 2 and 3, which are smaller but also have stadium seating, are decent.</p>
