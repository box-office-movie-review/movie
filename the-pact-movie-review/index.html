<p><strong>The Pact Movie Review</strong>. The story is about a nicole (bruckner) and annie (lotz) reluctantly return to their childhood home to pay their last respects. The best thing the pact has going for it is the way it manages to play its cards right, despite the fact that it doesn�t have many aces up its sleeve. As i thought, it was a good, but not great chiller, with some stiff acting and a neat twist. The pact 2 (2014) review.</p>

<p>The plot of the pact is actually good and attractive. Movie review of the new horror film the pact starring caity lotz, kathleen rose perkins, haley hudson, sam ball, mark steger, agnes bruckner, casper van dien and directed by nicholas mccarthy Tv movie tackles controversial issue of teen parenthood.
