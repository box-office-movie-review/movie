<p>We hope to see you at a nearby amc theatre. Alternate ending beer co., a craft brewery and restaurant now open in aberdeen, new jersey. The theatre, last known as the squire theatre, closed in 1976 due to a fire in the adjacent building that caused extensive damage to the theatre. It was located on west bel air avenue, just west of route 40. Originally set for a march 27 release, it was moved back to july. It was in the end, a happy accident.</p>
