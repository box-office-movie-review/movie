<p>I first read the reviews. In the book the sign of the beaver and the movie keeping the promise there are are similarities and difference. Four sticks for a month. See more ideas about beaver, school reading, novel studies. The cabin, in my mind, had a little bar, a table in the center, a fireplace right in front of the door, and a stack of fire wood on a fire wood rack on a wall. My favorite book/movie to compare and contrast is “bridge to terabithia” by katherine paterson.</p>
