<p><strong>How Movies Are Made Green Screen</strong>. This shot is called the background plate. While a professional green screen can be purchased for as little as $50, if your production is on a tight budget, it is just as easy to create your own green screen.

<p>Essentially, you could set up a projector behind a white screen hung behind your actors, and whatever you projected onto the screen would appear behind your actors. A green screen is a key component in a film and television production process known as “chroma keying,” in which foregrounded action is combined with separately filmed or constructed background footage. The most common colors of a green screen background are a light green background, a dark green background and a mint green background. You can use many materials for green screen and blue screen compositing, depending on your location, the scale of the project, the method of keying you’ll use, and, of course, your budget. The process works by filming actors in front of large, bright green backdrops, then isolating and removing that green color range, and replacing it with a different background.
