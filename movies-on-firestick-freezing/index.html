<p><strong>Movies On Firestick Freezing</strong>. I have a 4k firestick. Firestick keeps freezing and restarting. Click this three times and it should turn to “expert”. I cannot get plex to play a movie smoothly on the fire tv stick and let anyone else in the house use the internet at the same time.</p>

<p>If kodi is consistently crashing or freezing that’s a sure sign that something has gone wrong. Note that all of your settings, apps, and files will be deleted from your fire os system when you reset. It is the last option. Resetting a firestick 4k or fire tv stick takes just a few minutes and is even easier than unpacking a new fire stick. Apple even had issues during their the internet stream of the iphone announcement. Anne has the amazon fire tv but it keeps freezing up while watching the tech guy show.</p>
<h3 id="the-firestick-internal-storage-should-be-more-than-enough-to-hold-all-the-apps-that-you-use-on-a-daily-basis">The firestick internal storage should be more than enough to hold all the apps that you use on a daily basis.</h3>
<p>Bear in mind that your tv generates heat, and it might be transferring some of that heat to the firestick. Is your firestick frozen suddenly and you don’t know what to do with it then you came to the right place. This is not a problem with prime tv/movies, which stream perfectly. However, the firestick is not meant to be a backup storage device, so delete all the apps that you are not using. If the video keeps freezing or gets stuck loading: How frequently do you see a streaming application that gives movies, tv shows, live tv, sports tv, and adult content?</p>
