<p>If you watch a fair amount of christian entertainment, you’ve probably seen the dove seal of approval on many popular movies or documentaries. The movie has a very strong christian worldview as the main character clearly proclaims the gospel of jesus christ on egyptian tv and would rather die than say. Since 1995 the dove foundation has been publishing our movie reviews on the internet. Well over 100,000 families rely on these reviews each month to help them make informed choices about the entertainment their family can watch with confidence. Watch popular flicks such as the last ounce of courage, the 2012 movie about the war on christmas. Unknown on 19 october 2019 at 16:34 said.</p>
