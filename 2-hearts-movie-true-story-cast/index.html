<p>Overall, the movie was very poorly acted and the movie struggled transitioning from one story too the other. Grant.the story is loosely based on the real anna morgan who was taken by cheyenne. It is based on the true story of leslie and jorge bacardi and christopher gregory. Jacob will play chris and tiera will play sam, chris� girlfriend. “2 hearts” was hard for my heart.
