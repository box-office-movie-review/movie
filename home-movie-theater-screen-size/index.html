<p><strong>Home Movie Theater Screen Size</strong>. Let’s say the desired size of the home theater screen is 120 inches (measured diagonally). Just like it is uncomfortable for most people to sit in the front row at the movie theater, it can be uncomfortable for you to sit too close to a big screen in your home theater. Htmarket.com carries a large selection of home theater projector screens from popular brands like elite and stewart projector screens are available with a variety of options, from screen material to screen size to help optimize your projector image quality. If you use the thx guideline, a 120 projection screen is best viewed from 144 inches or 3.65 meters away while a 100 screen gives you the best experience when viewed from three meters.</p>

<p>However, smaller, typical family rooms around 10ft square are also fine for use with a large tv. Building a home theater that is 17.5 x 23 with the screen on the 17.5’ wall. Viewing distance, screen size over the past several years, i’ve slowly constructed a spreadsheet to meet all of my home theater design needs. If you’re thinking… read more » Probably too far away to be effective for home theater, ok for everyday tv viewing. Various aspects like construction and the number of rows should be taken care of while deciding the height of the riser.</p>

<p>When it comes to the right distance from your screen to your seats, the size of your tv or screen is important. This video is part of our home theater design series that covers virtually everything you need to know about designing a home theater. This is when hiring a home theater company skilled in theater design can make or break your home theater project. Aspect ratio is the fractional relation of the width of a video image compared to its height. If you have more than one row of theater seats, you should consider placing risers under the back rows, as an elevated back row for home theater seating gives every viewer a clear view of the screen and makes your home entertainment space more like a commercial theater. For a fully immersive experience, 20ft long by 15ft wide is best, with high ceilings.</p>
