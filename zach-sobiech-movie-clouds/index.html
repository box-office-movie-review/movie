<p>Zach sobiech hailed from lakeland, minnesota and was born in 1995. It was his debut and only single released as a solo artist, released digitally on december 14, 2012, and later included in his debut ep, fix me up (released under his band name, a firm handshake). Zach’s best friend sammy brown, played by sabrina carpenter, and girlfriend amy adamle, played by madison iseman, were two of zach’s biggest supporters while he fought cancer during his senior year of high school. She began writing the book three weeks after zach passed away, completing it 12 weeks later. Zach sobiech movie gets green light, as ‘clouds’ generates cash for cancer research.
