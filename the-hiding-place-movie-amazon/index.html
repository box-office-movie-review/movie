<p><strong>The Hiding Place Movie Amazon</strong>. This was a very good movie there was only one heartbreaking scene in. The movie is relatively faithful to the original story. Things that corrie or any other character in the movie say are from somewhere in corrie ten boom�s books, if not directly from �the hiding place�. It�s another ww2 film and introduces you to a wider story of what happened in holland.</p>

<p>Things that corrie or any other character in the movie say are from somewhere in corrie ten boom�s books, if not directly from �the hiding place�. Obviously it is a challenge to make the intense story into a 2 hour film, and i think the director did a great job. The movie is relatively faithful to the original story. The hiding place has been one of my favorites for a long time now. Buy the hiding place first edition by ten boom, corrie, sherill, elizabeth, sherrill, john (isbn: During ww2, a dutch family caught hiding jews is sent to a concentration camp where their christian faith helps them endure the hardships.</p>

<p>Things that corrie or any other character in the movie say are from somewhere in corrie ten boom�s books, if not directly from �the hiding place�. The movie is relatively faithful to the original story. From the very first chapter, i couldn’t put it down, and the first half of the book wasn’t even into the main storyline but an introduction of corrie’s family, home, and growing up years in a watchmaker’s shop in haarlem, holland. Obviously it is a challenge to make the intense story into a 2 hour film, and i think the director did a great job.
