<p><strong>Utc Mall Movie Theater San Diego</strong>. The movie theater in the utc mall is a kind of mixed bag: The place is worn, with seats that are comfortable, but never looked new (we’ve seen a movie soon after opening a few years back), and ticket prices are quite high. 11:00 am to 8:00 pm Macy�s and nordstrom are anchors but the last year has brought in many more chic.</p>
