<p><strong>Imax Movie Theater Screen Size</strong>. Saw spider man 2 2 days ago at the counties “largest” imax at amc lincoln square 13 and the screen was half the size. Imax has gone all out and created the worlds largest movie theater screen! Today many imax screens have shrunk to a fraction of those old monsters’ size, however, offering as little as 1,103 square feet of screen real estate. Is ultrascreen dlx the same screen size as imax?.</p>

<p>The difference between imax and standard screen is that imax screens are immersive and 6 times larger than standard theater screens. Typically, movie screens range in size from 30 to 90 feet wide by 10 to 30 feet tall. The typical imax movie theater screen measures 72� wide by 53� high. Complain to the theater operator and to imax , if it is the smaller imax digital system, and you feel so inclined. A typical imax screen is 16 meters high by 22 meters wide (approximately 52 by 72 feet), but they can be much larger. Anyways i said to heck with it.</p>

<p>Also the aspect ratio, 1.9:1, is much closer to that or a traditional movie theater (1.85:1) than a 70mm 15perf imax screen (1.44:1). Typically, movie screens range in size from 30 to 90 feet wide by 10 to 30 feet tall. As a general rule, the larger the auditorium, the larger the movie screen. My concern is that the theater has both regular movie screens and the small size imax at the same place. The typical imax movie theater screen measures 72� wide by 53� high. Imax will build you a home theater—starting at $400,000 includes dual 4k 2d/3d projectors, proprietary imax sound, and media playback.</p>
