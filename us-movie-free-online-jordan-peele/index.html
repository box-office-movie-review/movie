<p>Jordan peele’s debut horror film, get out (2017), pitched its black hero into a genteel white world in which lethal racist violence lurked behind every idyllic facade. Free shipping on orders over $25 shipped by amazon. Or $0.00 with a cbs all access trial on prime video channels. Us is only jordan peele’s second feature film as a director, but he has already developed the traits of an auteur. When the golden globes announced jordan peele’s get out as a nominee in the best comedy/musical category in 2017, the instant take (online, anyway) was that get out was too dark—too tethered. The jordan peele analysis of his own movie is pretty great.</p>
