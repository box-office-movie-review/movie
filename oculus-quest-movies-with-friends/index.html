<p><strong>Oculus Quest Movies With Friends</strong>. Oculus rooms was a very well designed space where you could invite friends, customize your environment, watch movies, play games, listen to music and much more. I’m trying to find an easy way to watch tv or a movie with friends on quest. It was with a big surprise that one day the app just disappeared with one of the firmware updates, and there was no official statement about the discontinuing. Bring friends along into vr worlds when you cast directly on a compatible tv or on the oculus mobile app.</p>
