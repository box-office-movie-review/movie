<p>Fireproof (2008) i was blessed to view this movie for the first time shortly after becoming engaged. While i’m waiting/ i will not faint /i’ll be running the race even while i wait. While there are so many sweeping scores to great films christian movies have found a wonderful outlet for christian music through soundtracks that feature songs that retell the message of the movie in some way. Throughout the history of the movie industry there have been few things that have inspired moviegoers (aside from the picture itself) as the movie’s soundtrack. This wasn�t the first time a christian movie has seemingly come out of nowhere to top the indie charts. It was made by pureflix.</p>
