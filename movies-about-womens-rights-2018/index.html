<p>2017 was a pivotal year for women, beginning with the historic marches that took place after trump’s inauguration and continuing throughout the year with an unprecedented surge of women stepping. Yes, these movies have always existed, but 2018 is giving us an impressive volume of these, particularly with movies full of women who are kicking ass. As we reflect on 2018, we are reminded of the many powerful ways that women’s movements are shaping policies, practices, and conversations—relentlessly pursuing crucial efforts to preserve or advance human rights for all, despite tremendous opposition. March is women’s history month, the perfect time to dust off your copy of the feminine mystique—or hit play any one of these amazing films made for, by, or about women. All the short film directors who has movies on human rights can submit right away at amnesty international india. The plan has five priority themes, but this call for applications is limited to “women’s economic participation and empowerment” and “women’s political participation and empowerment”.</p>
