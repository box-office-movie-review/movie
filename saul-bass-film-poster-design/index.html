<p>Saul bass was a world renowned and respected graphic designer. Bass conceived the title sequence as an integral part of the film and as something that. Due to copyright issues the book never saw the light of day. He worked mostly for advertising until his first major break: He began his time in hollywood doing print work for film ads, until he collaborated with filmmaker otto preminger to design the movie poster for his 1954 film carmen jones. For that, we can thank saul bass.</p>
