<p>The movie picks on an older apologetics target (that is, rationalistic atheism), and it names its opponents—bertrand russell, antony flew, freud, nietzsche. The case for christ movie reviews &amp; metacritic score: However, it also extols the honest search for truth. With erika christensen, faye dunaway, frankie faison, robert forster.

<p>I have had the opportunity to see the case for christ movie and i have been looking forward to sharing my thoughts on it. The case for christ also presents a riveting, dramatic depiction of an actual journalistic investigation. It shows that the evidence for christianity and the resurrection of jesus christ is beyond reproach. Mike vogel portrays chicago tribune reporter and avowed atheist lee strobel in “the case for christ” — a docudrama detailing the story of strobel’s attempt to disprove christianity after his wife becomes a christian. One of lee’s peers at the tribune , kenny london, is a christian with whom lee has a very contentious relationship for much of the film. The case for christ won’t garner many new converts, especially since the evidence presented, at least in the film, proves sketchy at best.</p>
