<p>Comcast recently removed turner classic movies from its basic subscription package: Comcast recently removed turner classic movies from its basic subscription package: Rationale given is that 90% of comcast cable subscribers watch 2 or fewer tcm movies a month and their cost of having tcm has doubled. Earlier this month, comcast quietly pulled turner classic movies from its basic cable subscription, making the channel available only to tv viewers who pay an additional fee to subscribe comcast. Fans of turner classic movies have been less than thrilled with the recent decision by comcast to move the channel to a sports entertainment package, which costs extra. If customers want to watch the channel’s variety of classic films, they’ll need to ante up an additional $9.</p>
