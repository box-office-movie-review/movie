<p><strong>The Apostle Paul Movie Review</strong>. Paul, apostle of christ is the story of two men. Paul, apostle of christ finds the new testament figure (james faulkner) aged and imprisoned by the romans. Here�s a movie that teeters on the edge of being really pretty good and loses its way. The film grippingly tells the story of paul whilst highlighting the plight of persecution and how we should respond, how we should love our enemies and show christ’s love and pray for those who persecute us, and lets also pray for the christians who are still persecuted even today.</p>

<p>Luke travels roma looking for apostle paul, turned in nero�s prisoner, to tell his story before his execution. With jim caviezel, james faulkner, olivier martinez, joanne whalley. There really is not much to say about this film. The movie is very faithful to scripture and truly honoring to god in all it presents. That gratitude overwhelms reservations on any other points. In fact, “paul, apostle of christ” works better as an easy and enjoyable introduction to its two central figures’ lives and works than it does considered strictly as a piece of cinema.</p>

<p>But we never get to see any of the good parts of paul�s life. But it is a lot stranger, and more disturbing, than you might expect. First of all, i am very grateful that such films are being made. That gratitude overwhelms reservations on any other points. It recounts the last days of the apostle paul’s life during the persecutions of emperor nero. By craig keener, originally posted on his blog.</p>

<p>Apostle blends atmospheric storytelling with grisly brutality to mixed results, but makes for an effectively nasty (and bizarre) horror movie overall.</p>
