<p>With ben lewis, anna o�byrne, maría mercedes, simon gleeson. But it does still work, really very well. Nothing against new york, i particularly love this city, but not as a setting for the phantom. Watch the movie trailer love never dies. The broadcasts started with the 2000 adaptation of joseph and the amazing technicolor dreamcoat starring donny osmond. Love never dies kills all the characters from the original, destroys the poetry existent in the phantom of the opera, and in addition to it, it is full of clichés with a bad end.</p>
