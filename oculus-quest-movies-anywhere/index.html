<p>I would love to be able to watch the movies that i have already purchased in oculus rooms with my friends and family instead of by myself on the browser without having to resort to buying a program to strip off the drm. It shows up in my amazon prime video collection but the prime video app on quest seems to be limited to hd / 1080p. Inside your car for example?. The hand controls are equally great, fixing one of the core disconnects i felt early on as using an xbox controller instead of being able to see your virtual hands in front. 3d is only two planes anyway. The movie, which first came to the oculus rift in november 2018, has been listed in the coming soon section of.</p>

<p>Posted by 2 years ago. Watch movies with friends in a virtual movie theater. Connect to your computer to watch movies, browse the web or play games on a giant virtual screen or in various theater environments. Please create a vudu app for the oculus and gear vr. That�s reserved for oculus video purchases, netflix, hulu and showtime at the moment. I just upgraded to a quest 2, and i don�t want what is still a lovely piece of tech to gather dust.</p>

<p>I can answer this there are not anywhere near as many 3d movies to choose and 2d movies look fine on the gear vr and even better on some generic vr headsets since less screen door effect.</p>
