<p><strong>The Seventh Seal Movie Review</strong>. Life, death, and the seventh seal. The passage about the seventh seal that gives the movie its title has deeper meaning, but it mostly seems to be a more complicated, poetical version of snapping your fingers in the darkness.

Perhaps that is why it is out of fashion at the moment.</p>

The seventh seal is not, after all, a medieval play, but a midcentury movie, and it bring in a midcentury attitude to provide something of a biting, sarcastic commentary all through the rest of the movie. It is a deep, mesmerizing, and darkly beautiful work of art. Starkly existential, boldly poetic, slow and grim, ingmar bergman’s great classic the seventh seal has haunted film aficionados, baffled and bored college students, inspired innumerable parodists, and challenged both believers and unbelievers for nearly half a century.
