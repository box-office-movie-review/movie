<p>A wonderful tale of love and destiny! It is a long quiz but it crazy when it works out, which is 87% of the time. This quiz is more of a guessing game. An imaginary and fantastic fantasy one should watch before dying. See, i can explain what makes a good movie to me by elaborating off of 5 of my favorite movies. This is a huge benefit on watching movies because they often give you something to learn from, you can see probably how a bad decision can change you life forever, how people influence can sometimes be bad for you, how everyone is capable of good thing in life, how by working hard you can.</p>
