<p>It is $6.50 per person for the movie not per car. We�re the only drive in in the area. Each screen sits in the corners of the rectangular field outlined by oversized trees. It later only operated with five screens as one screen was badly damaged in a storm several years ago. Thank you for your continued support. We provide insight on their discount prices so you can.</p>
