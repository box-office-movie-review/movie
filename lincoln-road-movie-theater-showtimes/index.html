<p><strong>Lincoln Road Movie Theater Showtimes</strong>. Accompany means the adult must watch the movie with the minor. On the plus side they played a movie that wasn�t showing in my home town. This theater is right on lincoln road and as many know this is a street only open to pedestrian traffic. This was the very best movie theater experience i�ve had in a long time.the reclining chairs and the spacing made viewing the movie much more comfortable and enjoyable.</p>
