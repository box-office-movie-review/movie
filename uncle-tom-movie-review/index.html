<p><strong>Uncle Tom Movie Review</strong>. Is it possible to be a “black republican.” uncle tom, by director justin malone, asks this and many other questions by interviewing several outspoken (and controversial) black, rightwing, media personalities such as larry elder, herman caine, jesse lee peterson, candace owens, and brandon tatum. In a collection of intimate interviews with some of america�s most provocative black conservative thinkers, uncle tom takes a unique look at being black in america. Yet as conservative commentator larry elder astutely points out, even that characterisation is false. As of this writing, the movie site imdb shows that over 350 viewers rated the film, giving it an overall rating of 9.7 out.</p>
