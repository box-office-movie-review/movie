<p>When we last spoke focuses on family, love and the power of forgiveness. When we last spoke (2019)two abandoned sisters live with their grandparents in texas in 1967. Although it was nothing like i thought it was going to be, this book was very enjoyable and a great read! Search movie times, buy tickets, find movie trailers, and view upcoming movies. In a new movie, melissa gilbert plays a loving grandmother, ruby, in the film “when we last spoke.” based on the novel by marci henna, “when we last spoke” is the story of two sisters in 1967 who are raised by their grandparents in the small town of fireside, texas. One of the things we’ve been able to do more of since all this chaos started, is to watch more family movies together.</p>
