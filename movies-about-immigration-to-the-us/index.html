<p><strong>Movies About Immigration To The Us</strong>. None of the films on this list are only about immigration but all use it to explore sad. A simple immigration issue spins wildly out of control for those involved, ranging from the president of the united states, to a news producer. “what are the best movies about immigration and immigrants?” we looked at 247 of the top immigration films, aggregating and ranking them so we could answer that very question!

<p>Films about immigration to the united states‎ (6 c, 58 p) pages in category films about immigration the following 143 pages are in this category, out of 143 total. That being said, i felt it was a massively unfair portrayal of the personal character traits of most of the officers in immigration and customs enforcement (ice) and united states citizenship and immigration services. Through cinema, we can find empathy and understanding. Immigration is a common experience for many latino families and no two immigration stories are the same. Some films like district 9 and children of men have had potential with useful or satirical points that got a bit lost i.m.o in the quest for action thrills. If viewers of the chinese exclusion act documentary end up with a sense of deja vu between the film�s subject, a law from 1882 that barred chinese people from coming to the united states, and current events, that�s pretty much the point.</p>
