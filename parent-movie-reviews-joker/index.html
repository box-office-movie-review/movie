<p><strong>Parent Movie Reviews Joker</strong>. Lena is a lonely girl, and is frequently bullied at school. This movie sounds like a morally bad movie or video game that says “there is only darkness, so do what you want.” from what i have heard, the joker’s actions do lead to the death of bruce wayne’s parents, paving the way for batman to emerge and fight evil, but it’s only hinted at, and there’s no batman or commissioner gordon to take. As social commentary, “joker” is pernicious garbage. Todd phillip’s “joker” opened saturday at the venice film festival to effervescent reviews, with many critics hi…</p>

<p>Joker is a movie that thinks it has a lot to say and fancies itself the social commentary of our time, but in reality it’s a mishmash of hot button social issues without anything interesting to say at all. The attacker slams the man’s head against a wall repeatedly and he is sprayed with blood as another man watches and whimpers in fear and the man that was watching is told to leave and the attacker lunges at him, startling him but he lets him go. Disregarded by society, fleck begins a slow descent into madness as he transforms into the criminal mastermind known as the joker. He then embarks on a downward spiral of revolution and bloody crime. Rotten tomatoes, home of the tomatometer, is the most trusted measurement of quality for movies &amp; tv. Very briefly, in the background of one scene, a character is seen lying in bed with a hand down his pants.</p>
