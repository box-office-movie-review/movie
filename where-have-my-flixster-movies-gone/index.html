<p>This is duly did back in july. So i have been searching high and low on both forums and my macbook as to where the movie files are being saved. The good thing about vudu is you can join with a uk paypal account. The movie shows up in the movies &amp; tv app, but i cannot find the physical file on my system. I have a very extensive movie collection that i can not access on vudu�s site. I live in england and am also frustrated with the flixster uv movies that are all over the place in different retailers in uk.</p>

<p>Catch the latest movie news, trailers, awards, and home showtimes 2. The movie shows up in the movies &amp; tv app, but i cannot find the physical file on my system. All you need is a usa address. I have attempted contacting vudu support and to no avail, there was no response, no acknowledgment, absolutely nothing. Ultraviolet, the digital entertainment locker that competed with disney’s movies anywhere service, is shutting down. But i must vent my frustrations.</p>
