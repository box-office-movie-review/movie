<p><strong>Ruin Me Movie Review</strong>. Ruin me is not your average run of the mill, ‘whodunit’ slasher flick. Overall, ruin me was an enjoyable watch based on a feasible concept with fun characters and multiple threads that are likely to keep you guessing throughout. Alexandra reluctantly tags along for slasher sleepout, an extreme event that is part camping trip, part haunted house, and part escape room. The 2017 film written by trysta bissett and preston defrancis and directed by defrancis, won best feature.</p>
