<p><strong>Movie Theaters In Baton Rouge Area</strong>. 15, movie tavern ciitplace 11, movie tavern juban crossing and malco gonzales cinema. Ua officials and neighboring storekeepers were interviewed and didn’t have much good to say about the theatre or the ‘safety’ of the area. The sheer size of the sets coupled with the amazing props, absurdly high tech, and crazy reveals are just by far way above the rest of the competition, and will make the sets of future rooms definitely a disappoin. in the lobby there is plenty of seating and games to accommodate large groups, making it beneficial for team building events (which i would highly recommend). Feel free to send me a pm if you need info.</p>
