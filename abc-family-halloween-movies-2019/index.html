<p>Modern family�s final halloween episode airs wednesday at 9 p.m. The network that arguably does halloween movies best is freeform (formerly known as abc family) and their 13 nights of halloween event is something we earnestly await each year. Last year freeform, formerly known as abc family, played “hocus pocus” nearly 30 times but that number was slashed to a mere 14 for 2020. Halloween movies are a must during the month of october, and while you can�t go wrong with a classic horror film like the shining, psycho, and the exorcist, there�s something to be said for new tales about things that go bump in the night.thanks to impressive new film technology and creative special effects, this year�s lineup of halloween movies in theaters looks. This year, you have more than a dozen chances to catch hocus pocus in october on freeform. Most of the movies we watch, the celebrities we worship, the musicians we listen to — in fact much of our popular.</p>
