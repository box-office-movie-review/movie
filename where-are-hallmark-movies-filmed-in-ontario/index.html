<p>The building’s position next to the mississippi river (the canadian one, not the american one!) makes it especially picturesque. Love them or hate them, hallmark christmas movies are super popular. Multiple places in canada gave their film industries the green light in june, but it wasn�t until this month that things really began kicking off across the country. Hallmark is officially shooting movies in canada right now, and between all of the wreaths, reindeer decorations and fake snow, it almost feels like christmas in july. Meanwhile, billy, a neglected and precocious 12 year old, hires a hit man to kill santa after receiving a lump of coal in his stocking. If hallmark�s latest countdown to christmas movie has left you wanting your very own small town holiday adventure, we have some exciting news for you.</p>
