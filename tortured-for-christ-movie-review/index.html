<p><strong>Tortured For Christ Movie Review</strong>. Voice of the martyrs has ridden on the coattails of wurmbrand story for years, asking for donations in his name, for his cause, so they could spend $28 million dollars on their building in bartlesville. Highly recommend this film for believers in christ to help empower and embolden their faith, and for those who don�t believe this film shows how much christ loves you, and thoughyou may not know him or you may hate him, christ loves you deeply and wants to have a personal relationship with him. Based on the true story of voice of the martyrs’ founder, tortured for christ chronicles richard wurmbrand’s harrowing story of capture and torment by communists while living in romania during the soviet invasion. Filmed entirely on location in romania, including in the very prison where pastor richard wurmbrand endured torture and solitary confinement, this is the cinematic retelling of one of the most powerfully inspiring and historically significant testimonies of all time.</p>
