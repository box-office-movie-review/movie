<p><strong>Walk Away From Love Movie Ending</strong>. But is the love story what you wanted people to to walk away with?. Ending an affair takes time, and one of the biggest difficulties of getting out of an affair is the temptation of wanting to get back into it at the very first opportunity. A youtube channel called the walk of life project believes the 1985 song by dire straights can be used for the final scene of any movie. The final scene shows david watching jade walk towards him through his barred cell window for a visit.</p>
