<p><strong>Stone Fox Movie And Book Comparison</strong>. In both of them there is a race,and there was a entry fee.in the movie stone fox did not slap willy.in the book stone fox did slap willy.i liked the movie better than the book because there was more to the end. Completed to reinforce a wide variety of language and reading skills at the reading level of the novel. After the movie the students analyzed the similarities and differences between an original text and its dramatic adaptation. There are a lot of differences and it is a popular book with both the boys and the girls.</p>

<p>The book is full of details about the boy and his dog, it gives great insight into the way people live that may not be as affluent as others. Thursday, january 12, 2012 joey 12 said. Stone fox has a change of heart and even though he could have won, he allows willy to carry his dog over the finish line and win. This is brainstorming for a compare/contrast paper based on the book/movie stone fox. There are a ton of differences between the 2 so it’s very easy to contrast for sure! Stone fox was acclaimed and very popular when it was published in 1980.</p>

<p>Willy�s grandpa also got sick in the movie, willy still found the letters inside the money box from the tax collector guy, willy still found that they only had a couple of coins in the money box, there was still a city slicker in the movie, and the indian stone fox�s dogs were still called samoyeds in the movie.</p>
