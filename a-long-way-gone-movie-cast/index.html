<p><strong>A Long Way Gone Movie Cast</strong>. With jack dorfman, lori simms. Happy face is an imperfect film about imperfect people in an imperfect world.this film is above all a personal story through which i sought catharsis—a way to free myself from the guilt of having been ashamed of my own mother when, sick with cancer, she lost her “beauty.”happy face is also the first part of my “cancer trilogy”—a project of three. My friends and i are debating about how long tom hanks was stranded on the island in the movie &amp;quot;cast away.&amp;quot; For anyone who has ever longed to go home again, long way gone is a radical retelling of the prodigal son story that takes us from tent revivals to the ryman auditorium to the tender relationship between a broken man and the father who never stopped calling him home.</p>
