With its haunting visuals and stellar acting, luca guadagnino’s remake of dario aregento’s witch coven horror “suspiria” had some of the key elements that would make it a noteworthy horror movie. Guadagnino�s sequel plan was set to take place during several different time periods in order to outline the ascension of helena markos—the primary witch of suspiria—whose powers are granted to her by mater suspiriorum/susie.</p>
