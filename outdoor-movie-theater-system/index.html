<p>We tested out our new outdoor movie theater system last night and it was lots of fun for us as a. You can host small groups of a couple dozen with our 9� system to well over 500 guests with our 20’ outdoor home theater system. For one price, you can purchase one of our outdoor movie screen and projector packages. The nebula by anker mars ii pro projector delivers a 720p image at 500 lumens, and can. This system produces 2 channels of sound — left and right. An aspect often overlooked when planning an outdoor movie night or party, is the actual sound.</p>

<p>An aspect often overlooked when planning an outdoor movie night or party, is the actual sound. Screen sizes ranges from 9’, 12’, 16’ and 20’ wide. Outdoor projectors give you that viewing experience that you can only find in movie theaters. Don�t just think movies.with the theater system, you can play one�s most precious moments to flash on the screen for everyone�s viewing, connect gaming equipment, music videos, animated shows for children�s events, and so much more. Connecting the sound system is quite, but it gets tricky when you plan to connect 5.1 speakers or any home theater system. Included is a recommended outdoor movie projector and screen, both of which i have tested and used myself in the backyard.</p>
