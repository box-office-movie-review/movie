<p>Coming to a grizzly end (via imcdb) the movie includes 105 minutes of, among other things, footage of an autopsy, piranha attacks, a beheading, a grizzly bear mauling a tourist, a drowning victim, a suicide, and a cannibal orgy. He is trying to show you the different �faces� of people while dying. One of the many pointless rites of passage for dopey teenage boys in the 80s (present company included) was watching faces of death on vhs. Faces of death portrayed itself as a film compilation of real suicides, deaths, and autopsies. Graphic content full movie 720p if you want to watch the movie in 1080p, heres the link: Directed by john alan schwartz.</p>

<p>Is it real or faked? Everything you see on this website is 100% real. It was kind of a rite of passage. Faces of death portrayed itself as a film compilation of real suicides, deaths, and autopsies. Real looking but extremely fake. None of the footage was real.</p>
