<p><strong>Movie Theaters In Orlando That Serve Food</strong>. Tell me about theaters with real food, like the enzian and the west orange five, and also anyplace that has particularly good popcorn or something else delicious to recommend it. I don�t know of any theaters in orange county that serve alcohol, but here are a couple of links for you to research. Amc goes far beyond classic concessions like popcorn and fountain drinks to give you an absolutely appetizing experience. The optional magic show before dinner was amazing and then when we went into the theater, the food was terrific, the show was hilarious and it was just a great evening! very interactive between the players (who were very quick witted and capable of bouncing off what the audience was saying) and the added audience participation within the mystery provided a lot of fun and laughter.</p>
