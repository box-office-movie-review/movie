<p>Trying to get a good position for step seating along with projector screen size? Whether the room dimensions will accommodate 150 inch screen with 2 row of 5 each My basement size is 33.8 feet(d), 26.25 feet (w) and 9.1 feet (h). This gives us enough space on either side of the row. For a fully immersive experience, 20ft long by 15ft wide is best, with high ceilings.

<p>A good home theater should have a screen size that is appropriate for the room. Whether the room dimensions will accommodate 150 inch screen with 2 row of 5 each The size of a home theater varies from home to home, and we’ve seen successful private cinemas tucked neatly into tiny attics. Instead, use a generally accepted ratio of h (height) x 1.28h (width) x 1.54h (length/depth). Your screen size will have the biggest effect on the comfortable seating distance from the screen. Movie directors understand that big sound is more important than big picture in making a viewing experience.</p>
