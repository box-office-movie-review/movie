<p><strong>Harold And Maude Movie Review</strong>. I like when harold�s mom tries to marry him off by inviting these computer dates mind you this is way before the internet and online dating, anyways each one of these computer dates are scare off by harold�s fake suicide which are hilarious. Harold, completely fixated on death, spends his time going to funerals, acting out fake suicides and going to the junkyard. Young, rich, and obsessed with death, harold finds himself changed forever when he meets lively septuagenarian maude at a funeral. The acting was superb, the dialogues were witty.</p>

<p>‘harold and maude’ movie summary the summary below contains spoilers. As performers, they both are so aggressive, so creepy and off‐putting, that harold and maude are obviously made for each other, a point the movie itself refuses to recognize with a twist ending that betrays, i think, its life‐affirming pre tensions. Even though harold and maude got mixed reviews from the critics for its dark humors, it ranked 9th place in romantic comedy genre from afi’s “ten top ten” list in 2008. In the film, harold chasen ( bud cort ), who has acquired a weird fetish of constructing elaborate but mostly realistic bogus suicides, was born into money beyond means. Sammi, 17, says this classic love story between a young man and a much older woman taught her that true love has no boundaries. Harold and maude is a 1971 film by hal ashby.</p>

<p>And so what we get, finally, is a movie of attitudes. By samantha sumampong, 17, bishop alemany hs the scene of a young man walking down his staircase preparing to hang himself is not a typical beginning for a love story. Even though harold and maude got mixed reviews from the critics for its dark humors, it ranked 9th place in romantic comedy genre from afi’s “ten top ten” list in 2008. Maude is a free spirit with an undeniable zest for life who likes to surround herself with. To start with, harold is a very eccentric character from the very beginning of this film. The vital counterculture (maude) helps harold avoid the army.</p>
