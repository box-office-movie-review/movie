<p>Would a movie theater be considered as a retail environment? I�ve worked at a movie theatre for the last five years. Life isn’t always as sweet as caramel popcorn. Expertise includes concession stand food preperation, box office working, specialized drink recipes, smoothie making, filing, and computer work. We are working on it. After that theater closed (and my parents got divorced and different jobs) i worked for one of the big chains (i worked for plitt, then carmike, then schulman theaters).</p>
