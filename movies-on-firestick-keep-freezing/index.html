<p><strong>Movies On Firestick Keep Freezing</strong>. Leo says that it�s more likely the internet stream rather than the fire tv. Firestick keeps sticking even when i clear all the cache on all the apps i have. If your kodi keeps shutting down or freezing directly after you take an action, go to the source of your action. Use and extender and keep the device a little bit away from your television.</p>

<p>A timer counts down before the process automatically begins, so if you change your mind, you only have about 20 seconds to cancel. If you want to stop your firestick from buffering, one of the first things you should try is restarting your device. If your kodi keeps shutting down or freezing directly after you take an action, go to the source of your action. I�ve tried tvmc, spmc, xbmc 13.2 gotham, kodi 14.2 helix, kodi 15.1 isengard on the amazon fire stick, fire tv, android phone (s6), and laptop across various internet connections (at home, work, friends). When your firestick freezes while opening an app or at home screen just grab your remote and press and hold play + select button at the same time. Check if our service provider may be down or may not be providing you the promised speeds.</p>
