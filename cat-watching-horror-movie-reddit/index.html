In creating this list, i�ve chosen to avoid established horror franchises, films with a strong cult following, and most other films that are either too mainstream or feature frequently in similar lists of underrated horror movies. Highlights of my traumas from this film include: There is a movie called the gate.basically some kids end up playing a metal record backwards, and it results in a gate to hell opening up in their back yard. For beginners, that�s great news! The most calming activity we can do is watch a horror movie designed to frighten us.</p>
