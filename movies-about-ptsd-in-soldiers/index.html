<p>One of the major challenges in understanding ptsd is the fact that most soldiers do not develop the disorder. Hear the true stories of brave men and women fighting for survival against ptsd. Here’s a list of 10 films about ptsd. Recent books and movies have highlighted the impact of war trauma for veterans of the vietnam war and the persian gulf war, but the traumas faced by veterans of world war ii and the korean. Seeing a similar trauma often sets off symptoms. While most of them are filmed just to trigger the nationalists’ feelings and thicken their wallets, very few of them do justice to the subject.</p>
