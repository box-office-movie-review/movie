<p>:) give me a film to watch! I would like watch something where the guy is younger(and handsome), but has a cool personality. (‚Äúplease recommend me to a good bookie‚Äù would be another example, imo, where i wouldn‚Äôt be requesting the name of a good bookie, but rather that a good word on my behalf be said to one). IÔøΩm way behind on my film watching but i should probably tell you what i like. An anthology series centering on different characters and locations, including a house with a murderous past, an insane asylum, a witch coven, a freak show circus, a haunted hotel, a possessed farmhouse, a cult, the apocalypse, and a slasher summer camp. I thought this was an excellent film i watched it one night late and then made my wife watch it with me the next day.</p>

<p>An anthology series centering on different characters and locations, including a house with a murderous past, an insane asylum, a witch coven, a freak show circus, a haunted hotel, a possessed farmhouse, a cult, the apocalypse, and a slasher summer camp. But this year the movie that hit me the hardest is a serious movie, hidden figures and i hope you either have seen it or will make it a point to see it. Its technically listed as a horror but its a lot more than that. Please recommend me a good movie franchise similar to the scream franchise? Titanic jim carrey movies gone with the wind nightmare before christmas benny and joon sin city anchorman pride and prejudice (not the keira knightly version. Something like devs, ex machina, annihilation, arrival.</p>
