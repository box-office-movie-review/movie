<p>Nari puts the average cost of remodeling a basement as $40,000 while basement guides state you can normally expect to pay between $10,000 and $65,000. One concept that beats them and appears the best match for the ambiance of the basement is the grand home theater. In the past, most clients put carpet in a basement bedroom and tile or wood floors in the rest of the space. You just need a minimal set of decoration such as movie posters, or framed arts. Fortunately, using these drop systems is the least expensive way to cover an unfinished ceiling. If you’re tired of waiting in line at the movie theater, paying for overpriced popcorn, and having to deal with someone kick your seat throughout the movie, it might be time to consider adding a basement home theater to your house.</p>

In the past, most clients put carpet in a basement bedroom and tile or wood floors in the rest of the space. The choices here are manifold in terms of complexity and cost, but you can use the size of your home theater as a guide. Visit any movie theater, and you will notice that their ceilings are covered with fiberglass panels much like the ones in the dropped ceilings you see in most offices.</p>
