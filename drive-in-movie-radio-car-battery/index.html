<p><strong>Drive In Movie Radio Car Battery</strong>. Car stereo drains car battery, it is recommended that you keep your car battery fully charged. :) but if you�re worried about it. Unless you have a bad battery, that should not happen. I�ve been to two and the battery was fine!</p>

<p>My ford ranger is 6 years old and has the original battery. You can find a portable radio on amazon.com for less than $15, plus If your drive in does the sound via fm, bring a boombox so you don�t have to rely upon your car stereo (and drain your car battery). It�s inexpensive, easy to use, and there�s less risk of draining our car�s battery. Having the heating on while the engine is off is much more likely to drain the battery than leaving the radio. You’ll need a portable radio if you sit outside your car.</p>

<p>Car stereo drains car battery, it is recommended that you keep your car battery fully charged. This can be especially helpful if your car has daytime lights that are hard for you to turn off. Unless you have a bad battery, that should not happen. So if you plan to sit outside your vehicle, bring a radio to listen to the sound. Movie audio is via car radio/speakers. :) but if you�re worried about it.</p>
