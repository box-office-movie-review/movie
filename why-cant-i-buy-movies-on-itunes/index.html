<p><strong>Why Cant I Buy Movies On Itunes</strong>. Itunes forever changed the way people experienced music, movies, tv shows, and podcasts. Sd costs less, if i�m going to buy something that it doesn�t matter to me if its in hd, then why spend the extra? I am having problem with movies from the itunes store. Ok here is what happened i wanted to clear up some space so i deleted all my movies and tv shows so nothing appears under the video app.</p>

<p>Currently you can’t buy itunes songs in the music app (or any app) on apple tv; I�ve seen this before where the buy buttons were available but the rent buttons were not, but that. To see if a film includes bonus features, like deleted scenes, trailers, or commentary, scroll down to how to watch and look for includes itunes extras under buy. Apple stores all of your itunes and app store purchases in your icloud account where you can easily redownload them. Ok here is what happened i wanted to clear up some space so i deleted all my movies and tv shows so nothing appears under the video app. Browse movies and tv shows that you can buy, rent movies, and subscribe to just the channels that you want to watch.</p>

<p>I searched for them in itunes on my imac. The apple tv app (yes, for all your devices, not just an apple tv) is where tv shows, movies and music videos will live on the mac, including hbo and showtime, and those itunes movies you bought. The apple tv app is the new home for all of your movies, tv shows, and home videos — including your purchases from itunes. In the paste, probably 4 or 5 years ago, apple actually indeed allowed their users to purchase or rent movies from itunes store, and then watch over projector via several settings. They showed up in the search results, but they buy and rent buttons were greyed out. I am having problem with movies from the itunes store.</p>
