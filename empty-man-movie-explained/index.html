<p><strong>Empty Man Movie Explained</strong>. The empty man is the latest horror movie that reminds you to never toy with a supernatural killer, including those summoned in a very specific way. So i�ll post spoilers for the boogeyman part. While there, he meets an unusual cast of characters, and starts to think this delivery might be more than it seems. Overall, the empty man was probably snuck into theaters without much fanfare for a reason.</p>

<h3 id="studiosthe-film-stars-james-badge-dale-marin-ireland-stephen-root-ron-canada-robert-aramayo-joel-courtney-and-sasha-frolova">Studios.the film stars james badge dale, marin ireland, stephen root, ron canada, robert aramayo, joel courtney, and sasha frolova.</h3>
<p>Early in the movie, his social worker asks him if he remembers why he was put in the mental institution. The empty man is a virus of sorts. One of those youths is amanda quail (sasha prolova), daughter of james’ good friend nora (marin ireland), who turns up at james’ place seeming vaguely troubled and spouting odd philosophical platitudes. The scariest thing about this supernatural entity is how empty, and painfully, unnecessarily long his movie is. A bunch of s*** teenagers summon up the empty man and they�re nowhere to be found the cop finds all of them except the one he�s looking for dangling under a bridge, hung.
