<p><strong>Lee Strobel Movie Cast</strong>. Unlike many christian films that often have cheesy plots, ideas, or delivery, this movie was the kind of movie that can rock someone, even an unbeliever, to the core. Things at home aren�t going nearly as well. I have owned numerous lee strobel books, and appreciated them for their convincing apologetics in the defense of christ. Mike vogel began acting in 2001 and has since appeared in notable films and television series including the help, the sisterhood of the traveling pants, poseidon, cloverfield, and under the dome.mike’s career began as a contestant on the nickelodeon tv show guts and he then modeled for levi’s.</p>
