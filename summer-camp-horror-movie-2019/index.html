<p>The quiet town of forrest lakes was paralyzed by devastating events that took place involving the myth of a bullied child, and his demonic revenge on the camp grounds where he had been murdered long ago. In 1989, school is out for the summer. With elizabeth mitchell, elizabeth lail, alberto frezza, mark indelicato. It is the first film in the sleepaway camp franchise, and tells the story of a young girl sent to a summer camp that becomes the site of a series of murders shortly after her arrival. Anyone who attended summer camp surely has fond memories of campfires, swimming pools, and cabins set in sprawling, wooded campgrounds. But this film is about a prank gone wrong when two boys try to prank the camp caretaker but end up causing a fire, which severely burns the caretaker.</p>
