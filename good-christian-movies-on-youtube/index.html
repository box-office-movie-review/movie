<p><strong>Good Christian Movies On Youtube</strong>. Every �80s and �90s kid who grew up loving ernest�s comedic shows will remember this 1989 christmas film.; This is the full film from 1984, originally based on the book by charles dickens.; For fans of christian movies, 2019 began with a top 5 hit (breakthrough) that demonstrated the power of prayer, and ended with a movie (a hidden life) that spotlighted an unsung hero of history. The one genre directly takes bible as script, visualizing the story in bible with proper imagination and guess.</p>
