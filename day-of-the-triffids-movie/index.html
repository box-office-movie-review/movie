<p><strong>Day Of The Triffids Movie</strong>. This 1962 version of the day of the triffids has been a tv staple for many years, more probably because of a lasting affection for john wyndham�s original novel than any high regard for the film itself. By the rank organisation and in the u.s. With most of the world blinded and the dangerous carnivorous triffids set loose, it falls upon a band of scattered survivors to fight this plant invasion and the madness following. As it was such a beautiful sight, most people were watching, and as a consequence, 99% of the population go blind.</p>
