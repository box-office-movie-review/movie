<p><strong>Movie Theater Speakers Behind Screen</strong>. The current center speaker is on top of the screen, so about 21� high, and it sounds ridiculous, i have to boost its signal by 3db for it to register the same output as the other tops. The screen at your local movie theater is obviously a lot larger than the specialty screens used in home theaters, but they actually have a lot in common. It is the finest theater sound i�ve heard since the 70mm magnetic track roadshow days when 10 hornloaded altec 15s behind the screen was common. The screen is a white fabric which is pretty much acoustically transparent.</p>

<p>It is the finest theater sound i�ve heard since the 70mm magnetic track roadshow days when 10 hornloaded altec 15s behind the screen was common. I just installed a home theater with in wall speakers behind the screen. No need to choose between an easier installation or a cheaper setup Without a decent sound system and audio, your backyard movie night is probably I would like to move all my speakers into the aquarium room out of sight behind the wall. 1) what is the optimal height for the speakers?</p>

<p>There are speakers in the walls to the left and right of you, largely for. With the advancement of technology in the surround sound systems and flat screen televisions, the home movie theaters have become more popular among people for creating a theater like experience inside their home. This is, in my opinion, where speakers belong, by the way—behind the screen. The screens in almost every movie theater have the front left, center, and right speakers behind them, along with a few subwoofers. We�ve been told that they are too low (currently about 3 ft off the floor). The screen goes ~20� high, and the room is about 35�deep x 45�wide.</p>
