<p>Luke travels roma looking for apostle paul, turned in nero�s prisoner, to tell his story before his execution. This is more than the five wide releases this year will earn. Paul is believed to have earned the enmity of the emperor nero at some time after the great fire of rome in 64 ad, and imprisoned and martyred, decapitated, on nero’s orders. The final days of paul the apostle are the subject of the new movie “paul, apostle of christ,” written and directed by andrew hyatt for affirm films. Risking his life, luke ventures to rome to visit paul — the apostle who’s bound in chains and held captive in nero’s darkest and bleakest prison cell. As paul discusses his life, he has nothing to boast of except his weakness.</p>
