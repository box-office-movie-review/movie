<p>It’s a pity this subgenre is so sparse. Few horror films can feel so dated (and, wow, do the fashions ever date society) and so continually relevant, and it’s a shame it’s a bit difficult to see these days. An ordinary teenage boy discovers his family is part of a gruesome orgy cult for the social elite. It doesn�t so much scare you as it builds a consistent tone of creepiness by presenting characters who are totally blasé about totally horrifying things happening around them. But, don�t go thinking this is a guilty pleasure. A teenage boy becomes wary of his family�s desire to please the upper class, and discovers the truth about a horrifying secret cult.</p>
