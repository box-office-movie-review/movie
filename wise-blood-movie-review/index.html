<p>Adapted from the august 24, 1962 edition of oakland tribune: The director, john huston, 73, is a genuine maverick: Part religious drama, part road movie, part demented black comedy, part satiric oddity, wise blood is as hard to file under a specific label as it is to watch without a reaction.

Sadly i was left disappointed, and has possibly lowered my expectations for the next film that i would be seeing from huston. Everyone, it seems, has drifted away via an interstate that a local tells him has been around “just long enough for everyone to drive off on it.”</p>
