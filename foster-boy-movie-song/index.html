<p><strong>Foster Boy Movie Song</strong>. This is a kid, and a character, people want to fight for, and it does the job i�m sure the creators of the movie wanted it to do, which is to expose what can happen to a child when a foster care system, a penal system, a jail, or any other institution intended to serve people is run entirely for profit. The movie touches on many themes unique to foster care and opens up many opportunities for questions and discussions. The foster son of the woman dubbed britain�s most sadistic mother has revealed how he is still haunted 15 years after escaping her clutches, and still lives in fear of bumping into her on the street. Directv cinema tv spot, �foster boy� submissions should come only from the actors themselves, their parent/legal guardian or casting agency.</p>
