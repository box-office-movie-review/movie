The skyview is very liberal in all of their policies as they allow alcohol to be consumed on property (responsibly), they allow pets (while leashed), they allow you to bring in outside food and they allow you to sit outside of your vehicles and move screens between movies. They switched to digital projection on both of their screens in 2016. They have a couple of special events as they hold a halloween party during october and a large car show during the summer. 28, 2020 at 12:06 am cdt.</p>
