<p><strong>Song Of The Sea Movie Review</strong>. Song of the sea 2014, pg, 93 min. This was also the same year that the lego movie was snubbed. Song of the sea is, in that sense a quiet film, but its serenity doesn�t completely make up for its formulaic narrative. This is especially disappointing since moore and screenwriter will collins try to avoid several clichés, like when ben (david rawle) confronts macha (fionnula flanagan), an antagonistic celtic goddess, and doesn�t try to beat her up, but rather to reason with her.</p>

<p>‘song of the sea’ movie review: With david rawle, brendan gleeson, lisa hannigan, fionnula flanagan. A gorgeous, almost painterly tale of two siblings trying to reach home, but waylaid by witches, owls and faeries Every scene of tomm moore�s beautifully drawn animation feels like a warm hug at bedtime.

<h3 id="song-of-the-sea-movie-review">‘song of the sea’ movie review:</h3>
<p>Visually, this is an exquisitely composed film, and it teems with curiosities and compassion. A mystical and strangely melancholy. �song of the sea,� by director tomm moore and voice work by brendan gleeson, is a masterwork of an animated film. Voices by brendan gleeson, fionnula flanagan, david rawle, lisa hannigan, jon kenny, lucy o’connell. Read the empire movie review of song of the sea. This visually stunning animation masterwork, steeped in irish myth, folklore and legend, so adroitly mixes the magical and the everyday that to watch it is to be wholly immersed in an enchanted world.</p>
