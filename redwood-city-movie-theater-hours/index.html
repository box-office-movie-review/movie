<p><strong>Redwood City Movie Theater Hours</strong>. Although i saw that the first 4 hours were free, i didn�t realize until i went to pay for my parking (at 3 hours and 54 minutes/$7.50) that i had missed the validation step (i had assumed that one wouldn�t be charged until after 4 hours). The space has a mix of moveau color schemes with traditional furniture. (24) hours from the time of your purchase from the site or participating cinemark location, but we do not assume any liability. I had to return to the theater to do this.</p>
