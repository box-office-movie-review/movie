<p><strong>The Witch House Movie Review</strong>. Hardly memorable characters by any means, but the actors and actresses did good jobs with what they had to work with. What not to do on halloween… go to an abandoned haunted house with a group of your friends! I think that is true for the first 10 minutes. Dreams in the witch house seemed to move a bit slow for my liking.</p>

<p>Poor teenagers, they always get bumped off. The movie focuses on a group of teenagers who decide to pull a halloween prank in a haunted house. With emily bader, darren mann, michelle randolph, arden belle. A finely calibrated shiver of a movie, “the witch” opens on a scene of religious wrath. Considering this is an hour i wasn�t sure if i would like the movie based on that. Dreams in the witch house seemed to move a bit slow for my liking.</p>
